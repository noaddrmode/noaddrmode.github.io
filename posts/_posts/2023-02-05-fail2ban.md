fail2ban 
1. scans log files - `/var/log/apach2/access.log`, `/var/log/nginx/error.log`, etc,
2. search for requests defined by filter in `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/*`
3. take actions (e.g., ban IP addresses) in `/etc/fail2ban/action.d/`

## Install fail2ban 
```
sudo apt install fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban.service
sudo systemctl start fail2ban.service
```

## Modifying Config

Default config is in `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf`. However, don't modify this file. Create local jail file instead.

### Creating Jail File

Create a new jail file in `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/`
```
vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/01-apache-ratelimit.local
```

Edit the file as below
```
[apache-ratelimit-1]

enabled = true
filter = apache-ratelimit
action = iptables-multiport[name=apache-ratelimit, port="http,https"]
logpath = /var/log/apache2/access.log
findtime = 86400
bantime = 1d
maxretry = 10
ignoreip = 127.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12
```

- `filter`	- is the name of filter this jail will use (`/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/apache-ratelimit.conf`)
-  `action` - what fail2ban will do when the request matches the filter. Here, it uses `/etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf` action. If you look at that file, it uses the `iptables` to ban the IP address. You can pass parameters to the action file. Here, it passes `` and ``. 
-  `logpath` - the log file fail2ban will scan. `/var/log/apache2/access.log`
-  `findtime` - specifies the time window in which the rate limiting will be applied (86400 seconds - 1day)
-  `bantime` - specifies the length of time that an IP address will be banned for if it exceeds the rate limit (1d - 1 day)
-  `maxretry` - specifies the number of allowed retries within the specified time window before an IP address is banned.
-  `ignoreip` - whitelist IP range

With above configuration, it will ban IP address for 1 day if there are more than 10 requests within 24 hours.

Time format can be found in `man 5 jail.conf`. Search for `TIME ABBREVIATION FORMAT`. You can use convert time abbreviation to seconds with 
```
# 1 day, 12 hours, 30 minutes
$ fail2ban-client --str2sec 1d12h30m
131400
```

## Writing Filter

Above jail file use filter `apache-ratelimit`. 
```
filter = apache-ratelimit
```

So, create the filter in `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/apache-ratelimit.conf`.

```
[Definition]

# Example apache2 log /var/log/apache2/access.log
# 192.168.56.1 - - [22/Dec/2022:19:18:47 +0000] "GET /api/v1/services/id/FFF0001 HTTP/1.1" 404 493 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/108.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"

failregex = ^ -.*GET /api/v1/services/id/.*$
ignoreregex =
```

Here, it searches for `GET` request to `/api/v1/services/id/`

Alternatively, you can search `429` HTTP response code from `X-RateLimit-Limit`)
```
failregex = ^ -.*"GET /api/v1/services/id/.*" 429 .*$
```

Or, search for POST, GET, HEAD requests
```
failregex = ^ -.*(POST|HEAD|GET) /api/v1/services/id/.*$
```

Modify `fail2regex` based on log file. Or, reuse the existing filters in `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/`. 

### Testing failregex
You can test if your regex is correct with `fail2ban-regex` command.
```
fail2ban-regex /var/log/apache2/access.log /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/apache-ratelimit.conf 
```

Look at the output for missed lines
```

```

Here `3 missed` with our current regex. If needed, adjust `failregex`.

## Restart fail2ban
```
sudo systemctl stop fail2ban.service
sudo systemctl start fail2ban.service
```

## Check fail2ban status
```
fail2ban-client status
Status
|- Number of jail:	2
`- Jail list:	apache-ratelimit-1, sshd
```

Here we have 2 jails, one is default jail (sshd). The other (`apache-ratelimit-1`) is the jail we created in `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/01-apache-ratelimit.local`

```
[apache-ratelimit-1]

enabled = true
...
...
```

So, two jails are currently active. 

## Testing
Modify the jail to test if fail2ban works properly. Reduce the bantime.
```
vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/01-apache-ratelimit.local
```
Ban IP address for 5 minutes if there are more than 5 GET request within 10 minutes.
```
findtime = 600
bantime = 300
maxretry = 5
```
Restart fail2ban. Make sure fail2ban is running and no error.
```
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban.service
fail2ban-client status
```
Make some HTTP requests. After 5 retries, you can no longer access the page. 
```
This site canâ€™t be reached

ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

Check the status
```
fail2ban-client status apache-ratelimit-1

Status for the jail: apache-ratelimit-1
|- Filter
|  |- Currently failed:	0
|  |- Total failed:	5
|  `- File list:	/var/log/apache2/access.log
`- Actions
   |- Currently banned:	1
   |- Total banned:	1
   `- Banned IP list:	192.168.56.1
```

You will see, it bans `192.168.56.1`. 

Check the iptables. Remember that we use iptables in jail file
`action = iptables-multiport[name=invoice-ratelimit, port="http,https"]`
```
root@u2204:# iptables -S
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
-N f2b-apache-ratelimit
-A INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443 -j f2b-apache-ratelimit
-A f2b-apache-ratelimit -s 192.168.56.1/32 -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
-A f2b-apache-ratelimit -j RETURN
```

## Unban IP address
If you make a mistake, unban IP address.
```
fail2ban-client set apache-ratelimit-1 unbanip 192.168.56.1
```
Check status again
```
fail2ban-client status apache-ratelimit-1
Status for the jail: apache-ratelimit-1
|- Filter
|  |- Currently failed:	0
|  |- Total failed:	5
|  `- File list:	/var/log/apache2/access.log
`- Actions
   |- Currently banned:	0
   |- Total banned:	1
   `- Banned IP list:	
```

Retry HTTP request to see if it is working again.

## Unban all IP address

```
fail2ban-client unban --all
```

## Check the log
```

## Redirecting to Another Web Page Instead of Dropping in iptables

Ideally, it should be done at application level. `iptables` work at different layer, and doesn't know URL redirection. However, iptables can be used to redirect port 80,443 to another port. Instead of default `filter` table, `nat` table should be used. Make sure to use `PREROUTING` chain.

Example iptable commands
```
# check rules
iptables -t nat -S 

# create rules
iptables -t nat -N TEST
iptables -t nat -A TEST -j RETURN
iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443 -j TEST
iptables -t nat -I TEST 1 -s 192.168.56.1/32 -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

# recheck rules
iptables -t nat -S

# delete rules
iptables -t nat -D 
iptables -t nat -F 
iptables -t nat -X 
```

### Modifying fail2ban
Create a new custom action.
```
vim /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-redirect.local
```

Edit as the file below
```
# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
# Author: Cyril Jaquier
# Modified by Yaroslav Halchenko for multiport banning
#

[INCLUDES]

before = iptables-common.conf

[Definition]

# Option:  actionstart
# Notes.:  command executed on demand at the first ban (or at the start of Fail2Ban if actionstart_on_demand is set to false).
# Values:  CMD
#
actionstart =  -N f2b-
               -A f2b- -j 
               -I  -p  -m multiport --dports  -j f2b-

# Option:  actionstop
# Notes.:  command executed at the stop of jail (or at the end of Fail2Ban)
# Values:  CMD
#
actionstop =  -D  -p  -m multiport --dports  -j f2b-
             
              -X f2b-

# Option:  actioncheck
# Notes.:  command executed once before each actionban command
# Values:  CMD
#
actioncheck =  -n -L  | grep -q 'f2b-[ \t]'

# Option:  actionban
# Notes.:  command executed when banning an IP. Take care that the
#          command is executed with Fail2Ban user rights.
# Tags:    See jail.conf(5) man page
# Values:  CMD
#
# actionban =  -I f2b- 1 -s  -j 
actionban =  -I f2b- 1 -s  -p  -j 

# Option:  actionunban
# Notes.:  command executed when unbanning an IP. Take care that the
#          command is executed with Fail2Ban user rights.
# Tags:    See jail.conf(5) man page
# Values:  CMD
#
# actionunban =  -D f2b- -s  -j 
actionunban =  -D f2b- -s  -p  -j 

[Init]

iptables = iptables  -t nat
chain = PREROUTING
blocktype = REDIRECT --to-port 8080
```

Edit the jail file, and use the new `action`
```
vim /etc/fail2ban/01-apache-ratelimit.local

[apache-ratelimit-1]

enabled = true
filter = apache-ratelimit
action = iptables-redirect[name=invoice-ratelimit, port="http,https"]
logpath = /var/log/apache2/access.log
findtime = 600
bantime = 300
maxretry = 5
ignoreip = 127.0.0.0/8
```

Stop and start fail2ban. 
```
systemctl stop fail2ban.service
systemctl start fail2ban.service
```

Now, open port 8080 in apache for the redirected page. 

```
mkdir -p /var/www/ratelimit
echo "Request Limit Exceeded! Retry again tomorrow." &gt; /var/www/ratelimit/index.html
```

Enable apache mode rewrite
```
a2enmod rewrite
systemctl restart apache2
apachectl -M | grep rewrite    
```

Open a unused port (8080). Redirect all requests to `/index.html`
```
ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
DocumentRoot /var/www/ratelimit
ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !=/index.html
RewriteRule ^ /index.html [R=301]
```
